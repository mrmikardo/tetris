#+TITLE: Todo
* [?] what options can be passed to `npx shadow-cljs watch frontend`
* [?] how to hook into `cider-jack-in-cljs`?
* [?] when to use def vs defonce
* DONE set up re-frame project
* DONE get it rendering a basic component
** e.g. a button which logs click events
* DONE add tailwind with JIT mode
* DONE handle keyboard events
* TODO tidy up a bit
** TODO utils module (for starters)
*** events/get-rotation-matrix-by-id-and-tag should live here
*** subs should not import events!
** TODO simplify some names...
* DONE finish tetromino rotation coords
* TODO `tetrominos` should probably be a map of tag -> vals
** doesn't make sense as a vector of maps
* TODO hitting SPC should drop the block in place
* TODO a tetromino should be a bundle of data you pass around
** i.e. extract the `active-tetromino` from the playfield, and that contains all the info you need
** ...rather than, as at present, it's all denormalized in the playfield record
